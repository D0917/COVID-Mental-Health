<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project was to predict responses to two sub-questions on the frequency of anxiety or depressive-like symptoms, respectively, in the past 7 days during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using deidentified data collected from June 1, 2020 to June 8, 2020 via the COVID Impact Survey, the tool I designed also looks at the features most important in the final prediction.
